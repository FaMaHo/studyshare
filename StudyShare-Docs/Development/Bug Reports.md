## ‚úÖ Resolved Issues

### 1. File Upload Validation ‚úÖ
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Date Reported:** {{date}}
**Date Resolved:** {{date}}

**Description:**
File upload was accepting invalid file types and not properly validating file size.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to upload note page
2. Try to upload a non-PDF file
3. File was accepted without validation

**Expected Behavior:**
Only PDF files should be accepted, with proper error messages for invalid files.

**Actual Behavior:**
Any file type was being accepted, leading to potential issues.

**Root Cause:**
Missing file type validation in the upload component.

**Solution:**
- Added file type validation in `src/utils/fileUtils.ts`
- Implemented proper error messages
- Added file size limits
- Created comprehensive validation function

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/fileUtils.ts` - Added validation functions
- `src/components/AddNoteModal.tsx` - Updated validation logic

**Testing:**
- Tested with various file types
- Verified error messages display correctly
- Confirmed file size limits work

### 2. API Error Handling ‚úÖ
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Date Reported:** {{date}}
**Date Resolved:** {{date}}

**Description:**
API endpoints were not properly handling errors, leading to unhelpful error messages.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Make an invalid API request
2. Check the response
3. Error message was generic and unhelpful

**Expected Behavior:**
Clear, specific error messages that help users understand the issue.

**Actual Behavior:**
Generic error messages that didn't provide useful information.

**Root Cause:**
Missing proper error handling middleware and specific error responses.

**Solution:**
- Implemented comprehensive error handling middleware
- Added specific error messages for different scenarios
- Created standardized error response format
- Added input validation with clear error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `studyshare-backend/src/index.ts` - Added error handling
- `src/api/api.ts` - Improved error handling
- `src/components/` - Added error state handling

**Testing:**
- Tested all error scenarios
- Verified error messages are helpful
- Confirmed error states display correctly in UI

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Dependency Conflict ‚úÖ

**Status:** Resolved 
**Priority:** High 
**Date Reported:** July 6, 2025 
**Date Resolved:** July 6, 2025

**Description:** GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing with ERESOLVE dependency conflicts related to TypeScript ESLint packages. The pipeline could not run `npm ci` due to conflicting peer dependencies between different versions of @typescript-eslint packages.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Push code changes to GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers
3. CI/CD pipeline fails during `npm ci` step
4. Error shows conflicting versions of @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin and @typescript-eslint/parser

**Expected Behavior:** CI/CD pipeline should complete successfully, running tests and deploying without dependency conflicts.

**Actual Behavior:** Pipeline failed with ERESOLVE error showing conflicts between:

- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^6.14.0 (specified in package.json)
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@8.35.1 (pulled in by typescript-eslint package)
- Incompatible peer dependency @typescript-eslint/parser versions

**Environment:**

- GitHub Actions runner: Ubuntu latest
- Node.js: 18.x and 20.x (matrix build)
- Package manager: npm
- Project: React + TypeScript + Vite

**Root Cause:** Conflicting TypeScript ESLint package versions in package.json. The project specified older versions (^6.14.0) while a newer typescript-eslint package was pulling in version 8.35.1, creating peer dependency conflicts that npm couldn't resolve.

**Solution:**

1. **Updated TypeScript ESLint packages** to compatible versions:
    - Updated @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin from ^6.14.0 to ^7.0.0
    - Updated @typescript-eslint/parser from ^6.14.0 to ^7.0.0
2. **Cleaned dependency resolution**:
    - Removed package-lock.json to clear cached resolutions
    - Ran `npm install` to regenerate with correct dependencies
3. **Fixed TypeScript configuration**:
    - Removed invalid `erasableSyntaxOnly` option from tsconfig.node.json
4. **Added missing Vite dependencies**:
    - Installed vite, @vitejs/plugin-react, vitest for proper build setup

**Files Modified:**

- `package.json` - Updated TypeScript ESLint package versions
- `package-lock.json` - Regenerated with resolved dependencies
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Removed invalid compiler option

**Testing:**

- Verified local `npm install` works without conflicts
- Confirmed `npm ci` works in clean environment
- Tested that CI/CD pipeline completes successfully
- Validated that test commands work properly with vitest

**Prevention:**

- Use `npm ls` to check for dependency conflicts before pushing
- Keep TypeScript ESLint packages at compatible versions
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when needed for temporary fixes
- Regular dependency updates to avoid version drift
